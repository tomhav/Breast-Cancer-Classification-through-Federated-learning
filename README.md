Abstract: On a day-to-day basis, hospitals engage in the transaction of thousands of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) data with other healthcare institutions, making data prone to various cybersecurity threats. In the present study, a federated learning framework is proposed, trained on the Wisconsin dataset. The framework incorporates various techniques to address challenges such as data scarcity and imbalance, utilizing the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance robustness. Additionally, isolation forests are employed to enhance the model's resilience to outliers. In the classification process across all devices, Catboost was utilized. An analysis was conducted to identify optimal features for achieving higher accuracy, employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Furthermore, the significance of hyperparameter tuning is emphasized through a comparative analysis. The model demonstrated an average accuracy of 99.95% on edge devices and 98% on the central server.
